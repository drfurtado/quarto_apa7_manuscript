Previously, these plots were found within the ICC analysis, but have since moved to their own separate analysis within the Reliability Module. I also discuss how to interpret these plots, which are used to support statistical estimates of ICC. JASP: https://jasp-stats.org NOTE: This tutorial uses the new preview/beta build of 0.17.

  abstract = {Test?retest is a concept that is routinely evaluated during the validation phase of many measurement tools. However, this term covers at least two related but very different concepts: reliability and agreement. Reliability is the ability of a measure applied twice upon the same respondents to produce the same ranking on both occasions. Agreement requires the measurement tool to produce twice the same exact values. An analysis of research papers showed that the distinction between both concepts remains anything but clear, and that the current practice is to evaluate reliability only, generally on the basis of the sole Pearson?s correlation. This practice is very problematic in the context of longitudinal studies because it becomes difficult to determine whether a difference between two successive observations is attributable to a real change of the respondents or only to the characteristics of the measurement tool, which then leads to a possible misinterpretation of the results. More focus should be given on the real interpretation of linear correlation, and when agreement is required in addition to reliability, then correct alternative, such as the Bland?Altman plot, should be more generally used.},

This study examined the concurrent validity of the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND; McCarron, 1997), using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC; Henderson \& Sugden, 1992) as the criterion measure. METHOD: One hundred eighteen children, 58 girls and 60 boys, 4, 5, and 6 years of age, formed the sample. Children were tested on both the MAND and MABC, which were then compared on their level of agreement in identifying children as having motor impairment. RESULTS: Inconsistent support for the MAND's discrimination accuracy was evidenced, and differences were found between the MAND and the MABC in the constructs defined for their development. With significant differences evident between the MAND and MABC, the MAND's cross-loadings on the MABC were plotted against the canonical loadings on the MABC. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable degree of independence was found between the MAND and MABC in the classification of children with and without motor impairment. The MABC appeared to have broader variation, and hence greater versatility, than the MAND.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The reliability and validity of the Test of Visual-Perceptual Skills (Non-Motor)-Revised (TVPS-R) were examined for its usefulness on Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers. METHOD: Content validity was evaluated by six experts. Test-retest reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity were examined on 66 typically developing preschoolers while concurrent validity was examined on these preschoolers plus 52 preschoolers with visual-perception difficulties. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability was high for the total score (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] =.88), but not for all subtests (ICC ranged .38 to .77) or for individual items (mean kappa = 0.32). The standard error of measurement (SEM; 1.53) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .90) were satisfactory. Evidence supporting the test's validity included a significant developmental trend (F = 4.99, p {$<$} .001), a lack of gender bias (F = .04, p = .84), and positive known-group differentiation (Wilks's lambda = 52.42, p {$<$} .001). The correlation between the Motor-Free Visual-Perceptual Test-Revised composite score and the TVPS-R composite was moderate at r = .60. CONCLUSIONS: When based on the total scores, the TVPS-R was reliable and valid. The use of subtest scores and item scores for decision making or treatment planning is not recommended.},

Accurate assessment in identifying index cases of active TB is essential in preventing transmission of the disease. OBJECTIVES To develop an artificial neural network using clinical and radiographic information to predict active pulmonary TB at the time of presentation at a health-care facility that is superior to physicians' opinion. DESIGN Nonconcurrent prospective study. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS A derivation group of 563 isolation episodes and a validation group of 119 isolation episodes. INTERVENTIONS A general regression neural network (GRNN) was used to develop the predictive model. MEASUREMENTS Predictive accuracy of the neural network compared with clinicians' assessment. Results: Predictive accuracy was assessed by the c-index, which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The GRNN significantly outperformed the physicians' prediction, with calculated c-indices (+/- SEM) of 0.947 +/- 0.028 and 0.61 +/- 0.045, respectively (p {$<$} 0.001). When the GRNN was applied to the validation group, the corresponding c-indices were 0. 923 +/- 0.056 and 0.716 +/- 0.095, respectively. CONCLUSION An artificial neural network can identify patients with active pulmonary TB more accurately than physicians' clinical assessment.},

The PEDI is a new functional assessment instrument for the evaluation of disabled children aged 6 months to 7 years. The PEDI has been developed to identify functional status and change along three dimensions: 1) functional skill level, 2) caregiver assistance, and 3) modifications or adaptive equipment used. The PEDIs were administered as a parental-report questionnaire, and the results were compared with data obtained by the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test (BDIST). The BDIST is a standardized assessment with developmental and adaptive content. Subjects were 20 children between the ages of 2 and 8 years with arthritic conditions and spina bifida and 20 nondisabled children matched for age and sex. All subjects' scores on the BDIST cognitive domain were no greater than 1.50 standard deviations below the mean for their age group. Concurrent validity was supported by moderately high Pearson product-moment correlations between BDIST and PEDI summary scores (r = .70–.80). Construct validity was supported by significant differences between the disabled and nondisabled groups' PEDI scores and by discriminant analysis identifying the PEDI scores as better group discriminators than the BDIST scores. Results validate the Developmental Edition of the PEDI and support the further development and standardization of the final version. Use of the PEDI in clinical pediatric physical therapy practice is discussed.},

  abstract = {"Mindful eating" describes a nonjudgmental awareness of physical and emotional sensations associated with eating. This article reports the development of a mindful eating questionnaire (MEQ) to support rigorous scientific inquiry into this concept. An item pool was developed based on hypothesized domains of mindful eating. A cross-sectional survey examined associations of MEQ scores with demographic and health-related characteristics. The MEQ was distributed to seven convenience samples between January and May 2007, with an overall response rate of 62\% (n=303). Participants were mostly women (81\%) and white (90\%), and had a mean age of 42+/-14.4 years (range 18 to 80 years). Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify factors, which were defined as the mean of items scored one to four, where four indicated higher mindfulness; the mean of all factors was the summary MEQ score. Multiple regression analysis was used to measure associations of demographic characteristics, obesity, yoga practice, and physical activity with MEQ scores. Domains of the final 28-item questionnaire were: disinhibition, awareness, external cues, emotional response, and distraction. The mean MEQ score was 2.92+/-0.37, with a reliability (Chronbach's alpha) of .64. The covariate-adjusted MEQ score was inversely associated with body mass index (3.02 for body mass index {$<$}25 vs 2.54 for body mass index {$>$}30, P{$<$}0.001). Yoga practice, but neither walking nor moderate/intense physical activity, was associated with higher MEQ score. In this study sample, the MEQ had good measurement characteristics. Its negative association with body mass index and positive association with yoga provide evidence of construct validity. Further evaluation in more diverse populations is warranted.},

In this study, we investigated the reliability of a new observational assessment tool. In Phase I, 110 video clips of children performing five locomotor, and six manipulative FMSs were developed. In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51-.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged. This study sets the foundation for the development of a new observational scale to assess fundamental movement skills.},

  abstract = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B\&A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B\&A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95\% of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B\&A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

  abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

Two studies on concurrent validity of the scale with an experimental gross motor task (stepping-stone crossing), the unifactorial subtest Locomotion of the Test of Gross Motor Development and the subtest Balance of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children as criterion measures, did not produce acceptable validity coefficients. In both validation studies an age effect was found. It was concluded that factor specificity does not seem the answer to the usual low validity coefficients of multifactorial teachers' rating scales. An alternative approach is suggested in which the assessment of functional activities in daily situations is stressed. Finally, the inclusion of atypical groups in random samples, which is common practice in research on concurrent validity of screening instruments for children's motor problems, is discussed.},

A correlation analysis of age equivalent scores indicated very good to high correlation for the BSID II Motor Scale with the PDMS Fine Motor Scale (PDFMS) (r = .87) and the PDMS Gross Motor Scale (PDGMS) (r = .83). A correlation analysis of standard scores showed poor to unacceptable correlation between the BSID II Motor Scale with the PDFMS (r = .64) and the PDGMS (r = .49); further, there was poor agreement between the classifications of significantly delayed, mildly delayed, and within normal limits performance on each test. The PDFMS tended to classify children lower than the BSID II Motor Scale. The scores of the relatively younger children within each of the PDMS 6-month age categories agreed less between the tests than did the scores of the relatively older children. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the concurrent validity of the BSID II Motor Scale and the PDMS for age equivalent scores, but not for standard scores of 2-year-old children. Professionals must be aware of the strengths and limitations of the BSID II and the PDMS, and choose appropriately to avoid denial of or over-referral for services for young children.},

The developmental sequences revealed common, qualitative changes in the movement of the children, although each child progressed through the changes at his/her own rate. The timing analyses showed that, in the advanced hop, the tightest limb relationships were found within the hopping leg, then between contralateral limbs of the same girdle, and then between legs and arms. Relative-timing calculations revealed (a) intralimb, timing invariances that were present in first attempts to perform the skill at age 3 and remained for 15 years across all developmental levels; (b) emergent, interlimb timings that gradually became invariant; and (c) intra- and interlimb timing showing gradual development over the 15 years. One invariant, the time between landing and deepest knee flexion, is also invariant in the walk and the run (Shapiro, Zernicke, Gregor, \& Diestel, 1981). Phase plane analyses indicated that the timing of peak and zero velocities may be the coordinative constant accounting for a relative timing invariance between the two legs. Position of the body's center of gravity may explain the invariant relative time between landing and deepest knee flexion, or the explanation could lie in the "equation of constraint" regulating joint equilibrium points. The data suggest that modeling the developing hop as the evolving interaction of four vibratory systems would be promising.}

The sequences accounted for 69–85\% (adjusted) of the total velocity variance each year. The components that best predicted ball velocity changed over time, although humerus or forearm action always accounted for considerable variance. Gender was a good predictor of ball velocity, but if the developmental descriptions were entered first in a stepwise regression, gender then explained no more than 2\% additional variance.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the validity of developmental sequences hypothesized by Halverson (Roberton \& Halverson, 1984) for the arm and leg action in skipping. Method: Children's skipping movements were categorized into the Halverson sequences using (a) cross-sectional video data collected on one hundred and fifty 5- to 12-year-olds, and (b) longitudinal film data collected on 7 children followed from age 3 through high school. Both data sets were graphed separately across age to see if the sequence levels rose and fell in accordance with developmental theory. Results: The longitudinal data indicated tentative validity of the sequences although study of younger children will be needed to validate the earliest levels of arm and leg action. In contrast to the children in the longitudinal study, relatively few children in the cross-sectional study had reached the most advanced levels of the skip by 12 years of age. Supporting the findings of Loovis and Butterfield (2000), the cross-sectional skipping data showed no gender differences (p~≥~.05). Conclusion: Future studies should continue the validation process as well as further examine questions related to gender differences in skipping and to the amount of practice needed to acquire advanced movement in this task.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavior in response to distressful events during outpatient pediatric surgery can contribute to postoperative maladaptive behaviors, such as temper tantrums, nightmares, bed-wetting, and attention seeking. Currently available perioperative behavioral assessment tools have limited utility in guiding interventions to ameliorate maladaptive behaviors because they cannot be used in real time, are only intended to be used during 1 phase of the experience (e.g., perioperative), or provide only a static assessment of the child (e.g., level of anxiety). A simple, reliable, real-time tool is needed to appropriately identify children and parents whose behaviors in response to distressful events at any point in the perioperative continuum could benefit from timely behavioral intervention. Our specific aims were to (1) refine the Perioperative Adult Child Behavioral Interaction Scale (PACBIS) to improve its reliability in identifying perioperative behaviors and (2) validate the refined PACBIS against several established instruments. METHODS: The PACBIS was used to assess the perioperative behaviors of 89 children aged 3 to 12 years presenting for adenotonsillectomy and their parents. Assessments using the PACBIS were made during perioperative events likely to prove distressing to children and/or parents (perioperative measurement of blood pressure, induction of anesthesia, and removal of the IV catheter before discharge). Static measurements of perioperative anxiety and behavioral compliance during anesthetic induction were made using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale and the Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC). Each event was videotaped for later scoring using the Child-Adult Medical Procedure Interaction Scale-Short Form (CAMPIS-SF) and Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress (OSBD). Interrater reliability using linear weighted kappa (kappa(w)) and multiple validations using Spearman correlation coefficients were analyzed. RESULTS: The PACBIS demonstrated good to excellent interrater reliability, with kappa(w) ranging from 0.62 to 0.94. The Child Coping and Child Distress subscores of the PACBIS demonstrated strong concurrent correlations with the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, ICC, CAMPIS-SF, and OSBD. The Parent Positive subscore of the PACBIS correlated strongly with the CAMPIS-SF and OSBD, whereas the Parent Negative subscore showed significant correlation with the ICC. The PACBIS has strong construct and predictive validities. CONCLUSIONS: The PACBIS is a simple, easy to use, real-time instrument to evaluate perioperative behaviors of both children and parents. It has good to excellent interrater reliability and strong concurrent validity against currently accepted scales. The PACBIS offers a means to identify maladaptive child or parental behaviors in real time, making it possible to intervene to modify such behaviors in a timely fashion.},

The DCD-Q met the standard for sensitivity (80\%) in the clinic-referred sample (81.6\%), but not in the population-based sample (28.9\%).

  abstract = {Preschooler Gross Motor Quality Scale (PGMQ) was recently developed to evaluate motor skill quality of preschoolers. The purpose of this study was to establish the concurrent validity of PGMQ using Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2) as the gold standard. One hundred and thirty five preschool children aged from three to six years were recruited from three kindergartens in central Taiwan. Two independent evaluators who were unaware of each other's results evaluated all the children separately in their kindergartens using standardized setting and procedures. Concurrent validity was examined using correlation analysis with Pearson-Production Moment correlation coefficient. The results show that the total scores (r = .86, p \&lt; .001) and subscale total scores (r = .82 for locomotion, r = .76 for object manipulation, p \&lt; .001) of the two tests correlated well. Analysis of similar items in the locomotion subscale found significant but weak correlations in the running, jumping and galloping items of the two tests (r = .23–.25, p \&lt; .001). There were moderate to high correlations in hopping, sliding and leaping between the two tests (r = .52–.70, p \&lt; .001). Low to moderate correlations (r = .37–.54, p \&lt; .001) were found between the similar items in the object manipulation subscale of PGMQ and TGMD-2. Total scores of TGMD-2 also showed a high relation between the sum of the locomotion and object manipulation scores of PGMQ (r = .83, p \&lt; .001). The total scores of similar items in the locomotion subscale of PGMQ and TGMD-2 showed a similar high relation (r = .79, p \&lt; .001) likewise in the object manipulation subscale (r = .75, p \&lt; .001) The PGMQ proved to have adequate concurrent validity with TGMD-2.},

  abstract = {Motor skills have great impact on children in adapting to an environment and developing interpersonal interaction, cognition, and social behavior. Understanding what children can do and how they perform it is essential. Most motor tests seldom contain quality evaluation in the items or criteria. The purpose of this study was to develop and construct validity of the Preschooler Gross Motor Quality Scale (PGMQ) that included 17 items in three subscales to evaluate the quality of fundamental motor skills for the preschooler. The study designed PGMQ items and subscales according to well-described procedures, and recruited 174 children, aged 3-6 (89 boys and 85 girls) from 17 kindergartens. Two independent evaluators who were unaware of each other's results evaluated all the children separately in their kindergartens using PGMQ standardized setting and procedures and Gross Motor Scales of Peabody Developmental Motor Scales II (PDMS-II). Results of this study found significant differences between different ages and genders (Wilks'Λ=0.221, p{$<$}.001 and Wilks'Λ=0.690, p{$<$}.001 respectively). Total scores and raw scores in three subscales of PGMQ increased as age increased. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed three factors, including locomotion, manipulative ability and balance to explain 51.06\% of the variance. The correlations between PGMQ and PDMS-II subscales were moderate to high (r=0.544-0.868, p{$<$}.01). The results showed satisfactory validity of PGMQ. PGMQ is useful to evaluate the development and quality of fundamental motor skills for the preschoolers.},

First, a cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate developmental characteristics within the three body component actions (arm, hand, and body) of two-handed catching hypothesized by Haywood and Getchell (2005). Data analyzed from 36 children (18 DCD, 18 AMC) aged 7-10 years who caught a ball 10 times, two-handed, showed that hypothesized sequences for the arm, hand, and body met the prelongitudinal screening criteria proposed by Roberton (1978), Langendorfer (1982), and Roberton, Williams, and Langendorfer (1980). In light of this, the second part of the study used these sequences to evaluate the movement patterns of 10 children with and 10 without DCD, aged 7-8 years. The data revealed that children with DCD displayed less advanced modal developmental sequence levels than AMC children with respect to the arm and body action components. (p},

Given m raters, we may formulate m − 1 weighted kappas in this family, one for each type of g -agreement.
