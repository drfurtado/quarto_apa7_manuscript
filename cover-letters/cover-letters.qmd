Dear Dr. J.D. Ball, Ph.D.,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to submit our recent manuscript entitled "Collecting Concurrent Validity, Expert-Rater Agreement, and Inter/Intra-Rater Reliability for the FG-COMPASS" for your consideration for publication in the revered "Journal of Perception and Motor Skills".

The manuscript, which extends over 28 pages and includes 1 figure and 5 tables, aimed to collect criterion-related (concurrent) validity for the FG-COMPASS by comparing its results with those of a criterion measure. In addition, this study sought to collect further inter-, intra-, and expert-rater reliability evidence for the FG-COMPASS from live assessments.

The manuscript builds upon an earlier work we published in the PMS (https://doi.org/10.1177/0031512518769205).

Hereby, we affirm the following: 1. The manuscript is being submitted exclusively to the "Journal of Perception and Motor Skills," and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. 2. All authors have reviewed and approved the content of the article, agreeing unanimously on the order of authorship.

We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to share our findings with the readership of the "Journal of Perception and Motor Skills," and eagerly anticipate your feedback. We remain open to undertaking any revisions deemed necessary to elevate the contribution to meet the exacting standards of your esteemed journal.

Best regards,

Ovande Furtado Jr.
