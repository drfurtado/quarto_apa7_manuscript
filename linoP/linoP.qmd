Fundamental movement skills (e.g., running, jumping, throwing) are considered the foundation the development of further skills required in physical activity throughout childhood and adolescence (Gallahue, 1982). During infancy, motor skill development allows children to explore their environmental context (Haywood & Getchell, 2014), and although children may reach a rudimentary level of fundamental movement skills (FMS), it is a common misconception that proficiency of FMS will be achieved solely through maturation. Children must be taught how to optimize their movement patterns in order to attain proficiency (Clark, 2007), especially during elementary years of education, where concepts and mastery of fundamental movements are easier to attain than at any other stage of development (Colvin, Markos, & Walker, 2000).

In addition, early mastery of FMS can lead to greater engagement in physical activity during adolescence and adulthood (Barnett, van Beurden, Morgan, Brooks, & Beard, 2009; Kuh & Cooper, 1992; Okely, Booth, & Patterson, 2001). Furthermore, children with lower FMS competence have been found to be less likely to engage in physical activity (Stodden et al., 2008) and have also been associated with childhood obesity (Cliff et al., 2012). Therefore, it is important to assess the development of FMS in children, whereas assessment tools can provide practitioners with an insight on motor skill proficiency, and may also provide insight on whether a child will develop towards an active or sedentary lifestyle (Stodden et al., 2008). Motor skill assessment tools are essential in the evaluation of motor skill development. Although many assessment tools have been developed, they are often designed for professionals in the field, such as kinesiologists, psychologists, and physical therapists, who often deal with gross and fine motor skills. Often, assessment tools are based on a component (specific body part configurations) or composite (total body configuration) method (insert citation). Alternative methods attempting to simplify the process of FMS assessment often use the three-stage model (restricting classification to three stages; e.g., "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"; Gallahue & Donnelly, 2003) and other methods include a decision tree based on specific performance criteria (Haywood & Getchell, 2014), where observers can assess FMS based on 'yes' or 'no' checkpoints (referred to as the observational plan approach- OPA). In addition, there are generally two types of motor skill assessments. Product oriented assessments relates to quantitative measures (measurements of time, distance, successful attempts). An example of an assessment battery using product-oriented assessment includes the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, which measures manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance (Wuang, Su, & Su, 2012). On the other hand, process oriented assessments focus more on the quality of the skill performed (Burton & Miller, 1998) . Examples of assessment tools using a process-oriented approach include the Test of Gross Motor Development (Ulrich, 2000) and the Motor Skills Inventory, which classifies FMS into three levels: rudimentary, functional, and mature (Werder & Bruininks, 1998). Although assessment tools might be validated and reliable, they reveal little about the development of a child, instead, these tests can reveal information about a child at a specific time in terms of criterion measures. The TGMD---2 compares student's scores to a national norm for the student's age and gender (norm-referenced test), whereas the Motor Skill Inventory compares student's scores to a specific domain of behavior or a standard of performance (criterion-reference assessment). The two proposed rating scales developed for vertical jump and gallop do not focus on individual comparison, but rather, performance over time.

# Results

First, we present the degree of agreement between the expert and participant ratings. Then, inter-rater rater reliability will be presented, followed by intra-rater reliability data.



|               |       Kw        |       ICC       |
|---------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| Vertical Jump | .96(.939, .978) | .98(.974, .982) |
| Gallop        | .89(.847, .926) | .94(.927, .952) |

_Note_. Sample size = 30. Values in parentheses refer to confidence interval.

Kw= Weighted Kappa; ICC = Intraclass Correlation Coefficient.








## How to Cite References

I am going to cite a reference here in square brackets [@CameronTrivedi2013]. This reference was in my bibliography file. Here are some variations on parenthetical citations:

-   Page references (or any other suffixes are placed after the reference. If you want a comma, you'll need to insert it yourself: [@CameronTrivedi2013, pp. 35--41]

-   Prefixes (with or without a comma) are placed before the reference: [e.g., @CameronTrivedi2013]

-   2 or more citations separated by a semicolon [@CameronTrivedi2013; @cohen2003applied]

-   Any prefixes or suffixes needing a literal semicolon will confuse Quarto (actually Pandoc). To make it clear that you need to print a semicolon, put a backslash before the semicolon: [FOIL; @CameronTrivedi2013]

Text references are possible, too.

-   @CameronTrivedi2013 said some interesting things.

-   @cohen2003applied [pp. 101--103] said specific things on specific pages.

-   Place the reference's year by itself with a minus sign: [-@CameronTrivedi2013]

## Hypotheses, Aims, and Objectives

The last paragraph of the introduction usually states the specific hypotheses of the study, often in a way that links them to the research design.

# Method

General remarks on method. This paragraph is optional.

Not all papers require each of these sections. Edit them as needed. Consult the [Journal Article Reporting Standards](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) for what is needed for your type of article.

## Participants

Who are they? How were they recruited? Report criteria for participant inclusion and exclusion. Perhaps some basic demographic stats are in order. A table is a great way to avoid repetition in statistical reporting.

## Measures

This section can also be titled **Materials** or **Apparatus**. Whatever tools, equipment, or measurement devices used in the study should be described.

### Measure A

Describe Measure A.

### Measure B

Describe Measure B.

## Procedure

What did participants do?

How are the data going to be analyzed?

# Results

## Descriptive Statistics

Here we describe the basic characteristics of our primary variables.

Let's make a figure. A reference label for a figure in APA format must have the prefix `apafg-`. This is different from the usual Quarto prefix `fig-`.

```{r}
#| label: apafg-myplot
#| apa-cap: This is the figure caption.
#| apa-note: This is a note below the figure.

plot(1:10)
```

To refer to any figure or table, put the chunk label in curly braces. For example, see {apafg-myplot}. In {apafg-importedgraphic}, we import an image.

```{r}
#| label: apafg-importedgraphic
#| apa-cap: This is an imported graphic.
#| apa-note: My note.
knitr::include_graphics("orcid.png")
```

We can make a table the same way as a figure except that the label prefix is `apatb-`. Again, this is different from the usual quarto prefix `tbl-`, which will put the table table caption in the wrong place and with non-APA formatting.

```{r apatb-mytable}
#| apa-cap: Here is the table caption.
#| apa-note: Here is the note below the table.
#| ft.align: left


tibble(Numbers = seq(1,4), Letters = LETTERS[seq(Numbers)]) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_apa() %>% 
  line_spacing(part = "all") %>% 
  padding(padding.top = 5, padding.bottom = 5)

```

To refer to this table in text, put the table's reference label in curly braces like so: As seen in {apatb-mytable}, there is not much information.

What if you want the tables and figures to be at the end of the document? In the .pdf format, you can set the `floatsintext` option to false. For .html and .docx documents, there is not yet an automatic way to put tables and figures at the end. You can, of course, just put them all at the end, in order. The reference labels will work no matter where they are in the text.
